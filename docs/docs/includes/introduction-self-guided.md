## Self-Guided Learners

These instructions are for self-guided learners who do not have access to a pre-configured lab environment. Follow these steps to set up your environment and begin the workshop.

## Introduction

This workshop is designed to teach you about the Azure AI Agents Service and the associated SDK. It consists of multiple labs, each highlighting a specific feature of the Azure AI Agents Service. The labs are meant to be completed in order, as each one builds on the knowledge and work from the previous lab.

## Prerequisites

1. Access to an Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/){:target="_blank"} before you begin.
1. You need a GitHub account. If you don’t have one, create it at [GitHub](https://github.com/join){:target="_blank"}.

## Select Workshop Programming Language

The workshop is available in both Python and C#. Use the language selector tabs to choose your preferred language wherever applicable. Note, don't switch languages mid-lab.

**Select the tab for your preferred language:**

=== "Python"
    The default language for the workshop is set to **Python**.
=== "C#"
    The default language for the workshop is set to **C#**.

## Open the Workshop

The preferred way to run this workshop is using GitHub Codespaces. This option provides a pre-configured environment with all the tools and resources needed to complete the workshop. Alternatively, you can open the workshop locally using a Visual Studio Code Dev Container.

=== "GitHub Codespaces"

    Select **Open in GitHub Codespaces** to open the project in GitHub Codespaces.

    [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/microsoft/build-your-first-agent-with-azure-ai-agent-service-workshop){:target="_blank"}

    !!! Warning "Building the Codespace will take several minutes. You can continue reading the instructions while it builds."

=== "VS Code Dev Container"

    !!! warning "Apple Silicon Users"
        The automated deployment script you’ll be running soon isn’t supported on Apple Silicon. Please run the deployment script from Codespaces or from macOS instead of the Dev Container.

    Alternatively, you can open the project locally using a Visual Studio Code Dev Container, which will open the project in your local VS Code development environment using the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers){:target="_blank"}.

    1. Start Docker Desktop (install it if not already installed)
    2. Select **Dev Containers Open** to open the project in a VS Code Dev Container.

        [![Open in Dev Containers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&label=Dev%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/microsoft/build-your-first-agent-with-azure-ai-agent-service-workshop)

    !!! Warning "The process of building the Dev Container, which involves downloading and setting it up on your local system, will take several minutes. During this time, you can continue reading the instructions."

## Authenticate with Azure

You need to authenticate with Azure so the agent app can access the Azure AI Agents Service and models. Follow these steps:

1. Ensure the Codespace has been created.
1. In the Codespace, open a new terminal window by selecting **Terminal** > **New Terminal** from the **VS Code menu**.
1. Run the following command to authenticate with Azure:

    ```shell
    az login --use-device-code
    ```

    !!! note
        You'll be prompted to open a browser link and log in to your Azure account. Be sure to copy the authentication code first.

        1. A browser window will open automatically, select your account type and click **Next**.
        2. Sign in with your Azure subscription **Username** and **Password**.
        3. **Paste** the authentication code.
        4. Select **OK**, then **Done**.

    !!! warning
        If you have multiple Azure tenants, then you will need to select the appropriate tenant when authenticating.

        ```shell
        az login --use-device-code --tenant <tenant_id>
        ```

1. Next, select the appropriate subscription from the command line.
1. Leave the terminal window open for the next steps.

## Deploy the Azure Resources

The following resources will be created in the `rg-contoso-agent-workshop` resource group in your Azure subscription.

- An **Azure AI Foundry hub** named **agent-wksp**
- An **Azure AI Foundry project** named **Agent Service Workshop**
- A **Serverless (pay-as-you-go) GPT-4o model deployment** named **gpt-4o (Global 2024-08-06)**. See pricing details [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/){:target="_blank"}.
- A **Grounding with Bing Search** resource. See the [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/agents/how-to/tools/bing-grounding) and [pricing](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/apis/grounding-pricing){:target="_blank"} for details.

!!! warning "You will need 140K TPM quota availability for the gpt-4o Global Standard SKU, not because the agent uses lots of tokens, but due to the frequency of calls made by the agent to the model. Review your quota availability in the [AI Foundry Management Center](https://ai.azure.com/managementCenter/quota){:target="_blank"}."

We have provided a bash script to automate the deployment of the resources required for the workshop. Alternatively, you may deploy resources manually using Azure AI Foundry studio. Select the desired tab.

=== "Automated deployment"

    The script `deploy.sh` deploys to the `eastus2` region by default; edit the file to change the region or resource names. To run the script, open the VS Code terminal and run the following command:

    ```bash
    cd infra && ./deploy.sh
    ```

    ### Workshop Configuration

    === "Python"

        The deploy script generates the **.env** file, which contains the project connection string, model deployment name, and Bing connection name.

        Your **.env** file should look similar to this but with your project connection string.

        ```python
        MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="gpt-4o"
        BING_CONNECTION_NAME="groundingwithbingsearch"
        PROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING="<your_project_connection_string>"
        ```
    === "C#"

        The automated deployment script stores project variables securely by using the Secret Manager feature for [safe storage of app secrets in development in ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets){:target="_blank"}.

        You can view the secrets by running the following command:

        ```bash
        dotnet user-secrets list
        ```

=== "Manual deployment"

    Alternatively, if you prefer not to use the `deploy.sh` script you can deploy the resources manually using the Azure AI Foundry portal as follows:

    1. Navigate to the [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com){:target="_blank"} web portal using your browser and sign in with your account.
    2. Select **+ Create project**.

        - Name the project

            ```text
            agent-workshop
            ```

        - Create a new hub named

            ```text
            agent-workshop-hub
            ```

        - Select **Create** and wait for the project to be created.
    3. From **My assets**, select **Models + endpoints**.
    4. Select **Deploy Model / Deploy Base Model**.

           - Select **gpt-4o** from the model list, then select **Confirm**.
           - Name the deployment

               ```text
               gpt-4o
               ```

        - Deployment type: Select **Global Standard**.
        - Select **Customize**.
        - Model version: Select **2024-08-06**.
        - Tokens Per Minute Rate Limit: Select **140k**.
        - Select **Deploy**.

    !!! note
        A specific version of GPT-4o may be required depending on your the region where you deployed your project.
        See [Models: Assistants (Preview)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models?tabs=global-standard%2Cstandard-chat-completions#assistants-preview){:target="_blank"} for details.

    ### Workshop Configuration

    You'll need the project connection string to connect the agent app to the Azure AI Foundry project. You can find this string in the Azure AI Foundry portal in the Overview page for your Project `agent-workshop` (look in the Project details section).

    === "Python"

        Create the workshop configuration file with the following command:

        ```bash
        cp src/python/workshop/.env.sample src/python/workshop/.env
        ```

        Then edit the file `src/python/workshop/.env` to provide the Project Connection String.

    === "C#"

        1. Open a new terminal window in VS Code.
        2. Run the following command to set the C# project path $CSHARP_PROJECT_PATH variable:

            ```bash
            CSHARP_PROJECT_PATH="src/csharp/workshop/AgentWorkshop.Client/AgentWorkshop.Client.csproj"
            ```
        3. Run the following command to set the [ASP.NET Core safe secret](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets){:target="_blank"} for the project connection string:

            !!! warning "Replace `<your_project_connection_string>` with the actual connection string"

            ```bash
            dotnet user-secrets set "ConnectionStrings:AiAgentService" "<your_project_connection_string>" --project "$CSHARP_PROJECT_PATH"
            ```

        4. Run the following command to set the [ASP.NET Core safe secret](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets){:target="_blank"} for the model deployment name:

            ```bash
            dotnet user-secrets set "Azure:ModelName" "gpt-4o" --project "$CSHARP_PROJECT_PATH"
            ```

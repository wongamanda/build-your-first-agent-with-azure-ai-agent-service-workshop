## Microsoft Build Attendees

The instructions on this page assume you are attending [Microsoft Build 2025](https://build.microsoft.com/){:target="_blank"} and have access to a pre-configured lab environment. This environment provides an Azure subscription with all the tools and resources needed to complete the workshop.

## Introduction

This workshop is designed to teach you about the Azure AI Agents Service and the associated [SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/ai-projects-readme?context=%2Fazure%2Fai-services%2Fagents%2Fcontext%2Fcontext){:target="_blank"}. It consists of multiple labs, each highlighting a specific feature of the Azure AI Agents Service. The labs are meant to be completed in order, as each one builds on the knowledge and work from the previous lab.

## Select Workshop Programming Language

The workshop is available in both Python and C#. Please make sure to select the language that fits the lab room you are in, by using the language selector tabs. Note, don't switch languages mid-lab.

**Select the language tab that matches your lab room:**

=== "Python"
    The default language for the workshop is set to **Python**.
=== "C#"
    The default language for the workshop is set to **C#**.

## Authenticate with Azure

You need to authenticate with Azure so the agent app can access the Azure AI Agents Service and models. Follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window. The terminal app is **pinned** to the Windows 11 taskbar.

    ![Open the terminal window](../media/windows-taskbar.png){ width="300" }

2. Run the following command to authenticate with Azure:

    ```powershell
    az login
    ```

    !!! note
        You'll be prompted to open a browser link and log in to your Azure account.

        1. A browser window will open automatically, select **Work or school account** and click **Next**.

        1. Use the **Username** and **Password** found in the **top section** of the **Resources** tab in the lab environment.

        2. Select **OK**, then **Done**.

3. Then select the **Default** subscription from the command line, by clicking on **Enter**.

4. Once you've logged in, run the following command to assign the **user** role to the resource group:

    ```powershell
    $subId = $(az account show --query id --output tsv) `
    ;$objectId = $(az ad signed-in-user show --query id -o tsv) `
    ; az role assignment create --role "f6c7c914-8db3-469d-8ca1-694a8f32e121" --assignee-object-id $objectId --scope /subscriptions/$subId/resourceGroups/"rg-agent-workshop" --assignee-principal-type 'User'
    ```

5. Leave the terminal window open for the next steps.

## Open the Workshop

Follow these steps to open the workshop in Visual Studio Code:

            !!! note "You may be asked what program to open the solution with. Select **Visual Studio 2022**."

## Project Connection String

Next, we log in to Azure AI Foundry to retrieve the project connection string, which the agent app uses to connect to the Azure AI Agents Service.

1. Navigate to the [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com){:target="_blank"} website.
2. Select **Sign in** and use the **Username** and **Password** found in the **top section** of the **Resources** tab in the lab environment. Click on the **Username** and **Password** fields to automatically fill in the login details.
    ![Azure credentials](../media/azure-credentials.png){:width="500"}
3. Read the introduction to the Azure AI Foundry and click **Got it**.
4. Ensure you are on the AI Foundry home page. Click the **AI Foundry** tab in the top left corner.

    ![AI Foundry home page](../media/ai-foundry-home.png){:width="200"}

5. Select the project name that starts with **aip-**.

=== "Python"

    ## Configure the Workshop

    1. Switch back to the workshop you opened in VS Code.
    2. **Rename** the `.env.sample` file to `.env`.

        - Select the **.env.sample** file in the VS Code **Explorer** panel.
        - Right-click the file and select **Rename**, or press <kbd>F2</kbd>.
        - Change the file name to `.env` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

    3. Paste the **Project connection string** you copied from Azure AI Foundry into the `.env` file.

        ```python
        PROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING="<your_project_connection_string>"
        ```

        Your `.env` file should look similar to this but with your project connection string.

        ```python
        MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="gpt-4o"
        BING_CONNECTION_NAME="groundingwithbingsearch"
        PROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING="<your_project_connection_string>"
        ```

    4. Save the `.env` file.

## Pro Tips

!!! tips
    1. The **Burger Menu** in the right-hand panel of the lab environment offers additional features, including the **Split Window View** and the option to end the lab. The **Split Window View** allows you to maximize the lab environment to full screen, optimizing screen space. The lab's **Instructions** and **Resources** panel will open in a separate window.
    2. If the lab instructions are slow to scroll in the lab environment, try copying the instructions’ URL and opening it in **your computer’s local browser** for a smoother experience.
    3. If you have trouble viewing an image, simply **click the image to enlarge it**.
